The solution often involves checking your `package.json` to identify dependencies that might be causing conflicts. Ensure that all dependencies are compatible with each other and with your Expo SDK version.  If the error involves `@react-native-community/masked-view`, try to update or remove it and test your app again. Also, check your `app.json` configuration file and ensure that your configurations are correct and compatible. You might need to reinstall the necessary native modules using `expo prebuild` or a similar command.  Carefully examine the specific error message provided by the Expo CLI for more details on the issue.
