This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the native modules used in your Expo app and the Expo CLI version you're using.  It can also manifest if there are issues with your project's configuration files (like `app.json` or `package.json`).  The specific error message might provide clues to the root cause. For example, you might see errors related to missing dependencies, incorrect module paths, or problems with the build process.  Often, `@react-native-community/masked-view` is involved.
